\title{Permutation Test for General Dependent Truncation}
\description{
Implementations of permutation approaches to test for quasi-independence.
The implemented approaches are powerful against non-monotone alternatives and
thereby offer protection against erroneous assumptions of quasi-independence.
The proposed tests use either a conditional or a unconditional method to
evaluate the permutation p-value.
Users also have an option to carry out the proposed permutation tests in a
parallel computing fashion.
